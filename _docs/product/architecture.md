## 1. Client â€“ User Browser
The client is a React application built with the Next.js **App Router**.

â€¢ **UI Layer** â€“ Components from `shadcn/ui` plus custom elements provide the interface.<br/>
â€¢ **State Management** â€“ A single Zustand store (`stores/surveyStore.ts`) tracks survey progress, photos, and validation results.<br/>
â€¢ **Camera & AR Guidance** â€“ Components in `components/Camera*` render the live camera feed and optional overlay guides (`lib/photoOverlays.ts`).<br/>
â€¢ **Local Validation Trigger** â€“ When a photo is captured the client instantly requests validation (see API below) so the user receives fast feedback.<br/>
â€¢ **Review & Submit** â€“ After all required photos are captured the user reviews the set and submits the survey metadata.

> Future ðŸ”­â€‚A lightweight YOLO model will run **on-device** inside the Camera/AR layer to give real-time framing hints.  It is not in production yet and is therefore dashed in the diagram.

## 2. Backend â€“ Next.js API Routes
All server logic lives inside the same Next.js project under `app/api/*`.

| Route | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `/api/validate` | Calls an external multimodal LLM (OpenAI Vision) to grade each photo and optionally extract data. |
| `/api/surveys/photos` | Generates presigned **PUT** URLs for S3 so the browser can upload images directly and privately. |
| `/api/surveys` | Persists survey metadata, validation JSON and skipped-step info to Postgres.  It also returns data for admin dashboards. |
| `/api/photos/[photoId]` | Provides time-limited download links for already-stored photos. |

The backend uses the `pg` library for SQL access (`lib/db.ts`) and `@aws-sdk/*` for S3 operations (`lib/aws.ts`).

---
## 3. Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
â€¢ **Amazon S3** â€“ Stores original JPEGs.  Files are uploaded under a temporary prefix and can be moved server-side if needed.<br/>
â€¢ **Amazon RDS â†’ PostgreSQL** â€“ Holds customers, surveys, photos and validation results.<br/>
â€¢ **AWS IAM** â€“ Minimal scoped keys used only for S3 access from the server.

---
## 4. Security Layer
â€¢ **HTTPS everywhere** â€“ Enforced by the Vercel/Next.js deployment.<br/>
â€¢ **x-internal-api-key header** â€“ Required for any external integrations hitting the API routes directly.<br/>
â€¢ **S3 presigned URLs** â€“ Ensure the browser never gains broad write permissions.
